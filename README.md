# SensorWebHub Project

SensorWeb Hub project represent a SOS solution for research data collected by low-cost sensor network

SWH is able to manage data from:

- Mobile stations/sensors Arduino based
- Conventional weather stations
- Eddycovariance towers
- Other kinds of sensors or stations (it is necessary create specific ETL modules)
